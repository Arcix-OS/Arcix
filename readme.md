# 🌌 Arcix OS

> **The Future of Android — Reimagined from the Source.**

Arcix OS is an independent Android fork built from the foundations of the  
[Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com).  

Designed for dreamers, creators, and power users — Arcix is a **smarter, faster, and more adaptive** operating system that bridges **mobile and desktop** experiences seamlessly.

Arcix OS isn’t based on any existing ROM — it’s built *from scratch*, with a vision to redefine how Android feels, performs, and evolves.

## ⚡ What Is Arcix?

Arcix OS is more than a custom ROM — it’s a **next-generation Android distribution** built to evolve beyond phones.  
It’s about giving users *real control*, *real performance*, and *real intelligence* — all while keeping the soul of open-source Android alive.

Every layer of Arcix is being reimagined — from the UI to the kernel — to deliver a unified, adaptable, and privacy-focused experience across any device.

> **From pocket to PC — one OS that adapts to you.**
