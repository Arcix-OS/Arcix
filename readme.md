### **The Universal Operating System for Learning, Creativity, and Progress**

Arcix unifies **mobile and desktop** experiences into one intelligent, adaptive system. It’s open-source, community-first, and designed to be affordable, private, and extensible.

## 🛠 Development Roadmap (High level)

- **Concept & Design** — complete ✅  
- **AOSP base & x86 prototype** — in progress 🔄  
- **Adaptive desktop UI & Arcix Mind** — design / early builds 🧩  
- **Education feature set & community pilots** — upcoming 🔜  
- **Early access & partner programs** — planned 🚀

---

## 🚀 Get Started (Early / Preview builds)

We’re building core systems now. Want to try, pilot in a classroom, or help test early builds?

- Star the repo and **watch** for releases.  
- Join the community channels (Discord / Matrix — links below).  
- Request an education pilot or vendor partnership via the contact form.

> Note: Initial builds will be developer / pilot focused. If you need production GMS (Google Play Services) or Widevine DRM, that requires licensing — Arcix will support FOSS app stores by default.

---

## 🤝 How You Can Help

Arcix is community-driven. Everyone is welcome.

- **Educators:** Share classroom requirements and pilot feedback.  
- **Developers:** Contribute code, device ports, and test suites.  
- **Designers:** Help polish UX, accessibility, and onboarding.  
- **Donors & Sponsors:** Support developer bounties and education grants.

**How to contribute**
1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a feature branch `feature/your-idea`  
3. Open a concise PR with description & tests  
4. Join the discussion in Issues and our community chat

_Read CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo for full guidelines._

## 💚 Community & Funding Model

Arcix is open-source and charity-oriented. We plan a hybrid model that:
- Keeps the core OS free and open under permissive licenses,  
- Accepts donations and grants to fund developer pay, and  
- Offers transparent funding reports and sponsor programs for schools and nonprofits.

We believe fair pay for contributors creates a healthier ecosystem and better software for everyone.

---

## 📄 License

Arcix OS will be released under open-source licensing consistent with AOSP and Linux foundations (Apache-2.0 for new components where appropriate). Specific modules may use compatible OSS licenses; see each repo for details.

### Notes & next steps
- Replace badge links with your real CI/status badges.  
- Add `assets/icon-dark.png` (your black-background logo) to the repo and update the path.  
- Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `LICENSE` files to make the project ready for organizational adoption.  
- Add a short `GETTING_STARTED.md` with basic build / test instructions when you have first builds.

---

Would you like me to:
- generate `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0) files next?  
- produce the `GETTING_STARTED.md` with AOSP + x86 initial sync/build commands?  
- or create a one-page landing HTML (dark themed) ready to drop into your GitHub Pages site (I already started one — I can finish it with your logo and copy)?

Pick one and I’ll produce it right away.
